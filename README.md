In this project we aim to develop a frontend for a movie database like website similar to IMDB, Netflix or Amazon Prime. On the homepage we can search for movie name by passing a token or the entire name and we get a result of movies that have that particular keyword in their title. To query the list of movie names, we have made use of the OMDB API which contains a database of movie names and their details.Further modifications can be made to the project to improve the overall design of the UI as well as create an option to view additional details related to the movies.
